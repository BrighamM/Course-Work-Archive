\section{Introduction}
This was a foray into the use of MPI. In my case I used openmpi. For this assignment we had to perform 3 basic tasks.

\section{ToDo's}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Get MPI working on your computer.
        \item Write an MPI program and execute it on your computer, where each process sends its rank number to rank+1%size and prints out both its own rank as well as the data it received.
        \item Write up a concise report in LaTeX that covers the steps you used to install MPI, and includes your code.
    \end{enumerate}

\section{Approach}
The above tasks were accomplished by google searching "openmpi install linux", the second result was then selected and on the third page of the pdf that is downloaded, the following shell commands were then used on my machine that runs native linux mint.
sudo apt-get install openmpi-bin openmpi-common openssh-client openssh-server libopenmpi1.3 libopenmpi-dbg libopenmpi-dev
