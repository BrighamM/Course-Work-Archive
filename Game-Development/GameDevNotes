jan2015 predicts the future

fortnight took a hit 100% overload


if I reply with dean m we are good.
if I reply with dr mathias we are bad.

office hours on the canvas, 4 creds, 

No req text for the class, use the internet
html5 games is ok

jonathan blow a programming language for gmaes

naughtydog is really cool

midterm test
develop a game in a 5 hour block of time.

we cannot copywright gameplay
we can make copies and clones


Taking notes with the computer today.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!



we can rotate rectangles with the code that was given in class.
we are working on modules today

we can write a report function for class today

we can invoke functions after they are declared

a module is an abstraction of stuff

semicolons are going to be added to bare return statements.

Jamis Buck the maze guy

randomly generating content for games 

jamis@jamisbuck.org

PROCEDURALLY GENERATED CONTENT.

talk about zelda nes

how would you do a random zelda

legend of zelda randomizers nes and snes

how do we mimic the zelda map?

how do we handle preconditions

this is a maze!!!

connected graph

perfect maze-no loops

zelda is not a perfect maze it is a braided maze.
now we are going to simplify hte maze, one block per tile

simplify biome map

lets use a randomized prims algorithm with multiple seeds

when we start a maze we start with a grid what walls are we going to erase??


randomly generate a maze and overlay it.

now braid the walls 
    -find all the dead ends
        pick a percentage and pick a random wall and turn iti 

braid vs culling
b=dead ends

seed scene
build scene
overlay maze
braid
cull walls
reset scene

how do we generate the individual cells in zelda "each screen"


Now we are going to use wilsons algortihm
    guaranteed to produce uniform mazes
    drunkards walk!
    loop erased random walk
    don't use wilsons for real time 

Start thinking critically about how to generate content, where, multiple factors are coming into play

determine exits
pick and carve

loop erased

erode

islands
    add obstacles


Divide the problem into smaller problems

solve each problem in the simplest way

expand the solutions to include more edge cases

rinse and repeat until you get close enough to your goal.




***************************************************************************************

start and ending points don't matter
we are makeing perfect mazes!

a few hints

gradient renderings
draw the entire maze in one path
the maze is being rerendered every time.

finding the shortest path
    depth
    breadth
    
the first thing on the path is the ending position
when you move to a new cell pop that cell off of the path.
when you move to a new cell push that cell onto the current path

when you pop the final piece off you are done.



fucntion drawImage(){

    arguments is an array that comes in as parameters to a function
    argument[0]

    if(arguments.length)
    // we have access to arguments which has access to the params to the function.



}

w3 canvas drawing

we have some texture that we want to draw onto the canvas
clipping is like shutter, take a clipping

change the texture name to model


lifetime of a process

init|             |term
  ready  <--> running
     |waiting|

we can use a menu stack
    Main Menu
        New Game
            + options
                video
                    basic
                    advanced
                audio
                controls
                    keyboard
                    mouse
                    controller
            + High scores
            + credits
            + exit




add a requirement that we need a background

Today we are going to talk about collision detection




Collision Detection
    3 main walls of arena
    blocks that can be hit
    the paddle, there are alot of options
    
Polygon by Polygon intersection test. THIS IS REJECTED OUTRIGHT!

Bounding box

if the bounding box around a stick figure is penatrated... kill
or do the boxes overlap? between two stick figures

testing two rectangles against eachother is pretty good

a simplification is

an axis aligned bounding box
    --aabb-- 

2d plane..

all the bounding boxes need to be aligned with the axes
the downside to this is as the character moves the bounding box will grow and shrink

another option is

a Sphere r1 + r2 less than d than we have a collision
an advantage is when the character rotates, the shere doesn't change


Its tough to draw a sphere on a really tall person you could collide really early 2d

rather than one sphere use multiple spheres

head, body, legs

complexity goes up

fidelity goes up

now wrap the snowmen in spheres

first test the outer spheres, than test the inner spheres

this can be nested .... alot!

we may have hundreds or thousands of things colliding in our game.

We want a spatial subdivision of the environment!
this is a very simple and effective way


use a grid and touch stuff only in the cells you are touching
this doesn't work well where we have crowding


This does alot of work for us!


QUADTREES
we have an environment with elements in it,
every node can have 4 children.

define a root node, in a square or rectangular environment
the root node is the whol environment.

If there are more than 3 elements, subdivide and get a newnode with 4 children nodes 
    a subdivision of node 0
Now we have a quad tree with no more than 3 objects in each node/cell



use 2d octrees


**************************************************************************************************

We are talking about quad trees again trees with in the end we are detecting collisions with quad trees.

One more thing on collision detection
object moving through a wall
do more than one physic updates vs frame updates
sweep the object through space thereby creating a square which has been formed, then do collision detection
on the square and circle.

BREAKOUT
detecting collisions
test paddle every single time
test the ball against the walls
if the ball is inside the box...
if the ball is inside the rows...
check the bricks

exhaustive could work for this.
How was the state managed
gameplay has an update and a render
3 different update functions
to handle countdown, something, something else

particle time!

particles in general
    fire and smoke particles
    has a lifetime... how long will it live?
    transitions to fire, smoke, water, etc...
    velocity
        speed
        direction
    curve~path
    how are these particles moving in some path
    Acceleration
    Size of the particle, not all the same size
    some sort spin/rotation
    visual properties, color and texture (fire and smoke)
    
a particle system is a sytem with a whole bunch of particles in it.
Particle System
    update all the particles and effects in game updateParticles();
    create effect(fire,pos,?)
    render
    
    or
    particle system render
        render(myPS)

PUT THE RENDER ON THE PARTICLE SYSTEM
IMPOSTERS
    boat racing water particles being kicked up translate imposters to particles.




???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????/

Now we are talking onthe monday before 

4th dimension game miagagurke 

something

maintain an array of particles

Final Project Discussion!


NodeJS from the beginning.

multi player networking for games.

clients and servers.

In multi player games we need trust

game model cannot run at the clients.

clients can only send inputs

server validates the inputs, turning rate, possible, etc..

Server validates all input from the clients. and  the server serves an updated state of the game.

Network lag is also a problem.

Speed of light is a limitation in multi-player games.




camera video notes!!!

brain parts and how they view and control vision, reasoning and thinking.

How do we properly scroll in a video game?

    Attention
        Use the camera to provide sufficient game info and feedback
    Interaction
        make background changes predictable and tightly bound to controls
    Comfort
        Ease and contextualize background changes


    Position locking, camera moves with the character rally-x and kung fu master

    terraria uses string position locking cross-hairs
    8 minutes timer

    camera window jump-bug
        as you touch the edge of a window it will move the camera

    rastan saga
        offset window also used in Fez

dual forward focus

CUE FOCUS
AS YOU GET CLOSE TO ATTRACTORS, SLOWLY SHIFT THE CAMERA TOWARDS THE ATTRACTORS

YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHERE YOU IN RELation to the center

44:33 build your camera solution!



****************************MORE NOTES******************************************


Web hosting and web servers!
We could use a whole semester for this idea

browser window box where things are rendered.

THen to the side we have a webserver with various files
index.html, code, image...

From the server we need to get the files over to the browser.

So the user makes some sort of http(s) request
Somewhere out in the cloud a dns look up is made and we get the address back

THen the browser starts making requests to that number.

From the browser to the Webserver we are communicating through TCP
udp - no gaurantee
tcp - gauranteed

then the server and the browser start talking to each other.


Dr. Mathias said to make a twin shooter and something about robot fights

and to work on the battle royale!

server game model
rendering



handling input



form the two vectors dot product stuff in the demo.


More Game Cameras!

focus attention on something other than themselves

learn and formalize cinematography to teach it to the software. --gamatography
    fixed angle third person
    dynamic third person
    first person

THe distance between the camera and the avatar
ALWAYS HONOR THE PLAYERS INTENT


                


******************************
some extra stuff I think I will need for the final!

Make a timer thing that takes up a certain fractional of the overall canvas. like the top 8th by 8th
Inside this box place your score and time

given a square and a point is the point inside the square

given a two squares, are they intersecting.

given two spheres, are they intersecting

given a point and a circle, is the point inside the square
